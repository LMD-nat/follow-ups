# Follow-Ups

A k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) classification model designed to distinguish early re-visits to the ER from planned follow-up visits. 

- A k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric supervised learning method. It's a form of machine learning. 
- In k-NN classification (the present model) the output is a class membership (here: 1 or 0, follow-up visit to the ER or not). 

To run the model use the `knn_model` script. Everything should run smoothly because the data is all stored publicly on this repository. Also, no actual patient data was used. It's all simulated, so it's probably not very generalizable.
